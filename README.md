### conclusion
This project demonstrates how a basic CNN can effectively classify animal images using the PyTorch framework. With just a few layers and minimal tuning, the model achieves decent performance on a multi-class image dataset. It serves as a great starting point for beginners to understand image classification and deep learning workflows. Future improvements like data augmentation, more training epochs, or transfer learning with pretrained models can further boost accuracy and generalization.
